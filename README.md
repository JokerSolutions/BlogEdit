# JokerSolutions BlogEdit

This software intends to be a modern and sleek replacement/alternative to current desktop blog editors.
Build with C# we intend to create a software that is unobtrusive while editing and easy to use.

The end product (compiled installer) is NOT going to be free (as in beer) but the source code will be made available to all those interested in helping in this project.

## Project goals
In its infancy the software will be concentrating on design over functionality as this is going to be a learning exercise for myself ( [@smeierzubiesen](https://github.com/smeierzubieseb) ) to learn to create WPF applications.

## Technology
We will be using C# on a WPF platform with material design paradigms. Primarly we will be concentrating on WordPress connectivity, based upon their REST API.
Long-term we will create this software to be modular and thus enabling it to also interact with other blogging software, as long as it offers a XML-RPC/REST API
